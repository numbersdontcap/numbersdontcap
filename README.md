I'm learning full-stack development in public â€” open source, serverless, and everything in between.

### Current Focus
-  Building my foundation with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git
-  Creating a serverless portfolio site from scratch
-  Exploring beginner-friendly open source projects to contribute to

###  Skill Stack (Learning Roadmap)
`HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` `Git/GitHub`  
Coming soon: `React` `Node.js` `MongoDB` `Tailwind` `Next.js`

### Projects in Progress
- `portfolio-v1`: My personal site, built from the ground up
- Open-source contributions coming soon...

 Everything here is a snapshot of the process, not perfection.
